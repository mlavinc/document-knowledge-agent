An AWS infrastructure project built to demonstrate Cloud Engineering skills end-to-end: Infrastructure as Code, automated monitoring, operational automation, and a full CI/CD deployment pipeline with manual approval gates.

The project was built incrementally in five sprints, each adding a capability layer on top of the last.

### Why OIDC instead of AWS Access Keys

GitHub OIDC lets GitHub Actions request a short-lived, automatically expiring AWS credential tied to a specific job. There are no long-lived secrets stored anywhere — nothing to rotate, nothing to accidentally leak. If the OIDC token is somehow obtained, it is already expired by the time it could be misused.

### Two separate IAM roles, different trust conditions

| Role | When it can be assumed | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `github-ci` | Any workflow in this repository (PRs, any branch) | `ReadOnlyAccess` + state backend |
| `github-apply` | Only workflows running inside the `dev` GitHub Environment | Custom write policy + state backend |

When a job declares `environment: dev` in GitHub Actions, the OIDC token's `sub` claim changes from `repo:{org}/{repo}:ref:refs/heads/...` to `repo:{org}/{repo}:environment:dev`. The apply role trust policy matches only this second form using `StringEquals`. A rogue workflow that omits the environment declaration produces a different `sub` and cannot assume the apply role — even if it knows the ARN. This is enforced cryptographically by AWS, not just by workflow logic.

## Sprint Build Log

The project was built in five sprints. Each sprint is independently testable.

### Sprint 1 — Infrastructure Foundation

Establishes the networking, compute, and secure access skeleton.

- **Terraform remote state**: S3 bucket (versioned, all public access blocked) stores the state file. DynamoDB provides lock acquisition so concurrent runs cannot corrupt state.
- **VPC**: Isolated network in `us-east-1` with a public subnet, Internet Gateway, and an explicit route table.
- **Security Group**: Egress-only — no inbound ports open at all. SSM Session Manager connects outbound over HTTPS to the SSM service endpoint. Port 22 is never needed.
- **EC2**: `t3.micro` running Amazon Linux 2023. No SSH key pair is generated or stored. The only way to access the instance is through SSM Session Manager.
- **IAM**: Instance role with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` managed policy. This is the minimum permission set for SSM to function.

### Sprint 2 — CloudWatch Monitoring

Adds observability so you can see what the instance is doing without accessing it.

- **CloudWatch Agent**: Installed and configured via EC2 `user_data`. Collects system logs and instance metrics.
- **Logging fix for Amazon Linux 2023**: AL2023 uses `systemd-journald` and does not write to `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/secure` by default. `rsyslog` is installed in `user_data` to bridge `journald` output into those files, which the CloudWatch Agent then reads.
- **CPU alarm**: Triggers when utilisation stays above 80% for two consecutive 5-minute periods. Designed to catch runaway processes, not momentary spikes.
- **SNS topic**: Receives the alarm signal and sends an email notification. Requires inbox confirmation before alerts are delivered.
- **IAM update**: `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` added to the instance role.

### Sprint 3 — Operational Automation

The instance can now report its own health and log operational events to a persistent, queryable store.

- **DynamoDB ops-logs table**: Each item is a structured event keyed by `instance_id` (partition) and `log_timestamp` (sort key, ISO 8601). A TTL attribute automatically expires entries after 30 days — the table never needs manual cleanup.
- **SSM Parameter Store**: Stores the DynamoDB table name and region. Scripts look up their target at runtime from this parameter, so they work correctly across environments without any hard-coded values.
- **SSM Run Command documents**: Two documents embed the bash scripts and can be executed from the AWS Console or CLI without any shell access to the instance.
  - `health-check`: Collects CPU idle percentage, load average, available memory, and disk usage, then writes a structured item to DynamoDB.
  - `log-event`: Writes a named event (e.g. `deployment`, `maintenance`) with an optional message to DynamoDB.
- **Windows line-ending fix**: The bash scripts are developed on Windows (CRLF line endings). The shebang line `#!/bin/bash\r` is not recognised by the Linux kernel, causing the script to fail with "required file not found". Terraform normalises line endings to LF using `replace()` before embedding the script content in the SSM document.
- **IAM `count` fix**: The ops-automation inline policy uses `count = var.enable_ops_automation ? 1 : 0`. Using the DynamoDB table ARN (a computed value) directly in `count` would fail at plan time because Terraform cannot determine `count` until apply. A boolean variable is known at plan time and avoids this error entirely.
- **IAM update**: Scoped inline policy adds `dynamodb:PutItem` (specific table ARN only) and `ssm:GetParameter` (specific parameter path only).

### Sprint 4 — GitHub Actions CI

Every Pull Request gets an automated Terraform plan. No engineer needs to run Terraform locally to review an infrastructure change.

- **GitHub OIDC Provider**: Registered once in the AWS account during bootstrap. GitHub Actions presents a signed JWT; AWS verifies it against this provider and issues temporary credentials.
- **CI IAM Role**: `ReadOnlyAccess` is sufficient for `terraform plan` since it never writes infrastructure. Trust policy is scoped to this specific repository's OIDC subject.
- **Plan output capture fix**: `steps.*.outputs.stdout` is unreliable for large outputs or when `continue-on-error: true` is set. The plan step redirects output to `/tmp/tfplan.txt` using `tee` and `PIPESTATUS` (to preserve the exit code through the pipe). The PR comment step reads directly from that file.
- **`.gitignore` precision fix**: The initial `*.tfvars` rule ignored `dev.tfvars`, preventing CI from reading environment variables. Fixed to ignore only auto-loaded files (`terraform.tfvars`, `*.auto.tfvars`) while allowing named environment files like `dev.tfvars` to be committed and tracked.

### Sprint 5 — Controlled Deployment

`terraform apply` now requires a merge to `main` AND explicit human approval. No infrastructure is ever changed automatically.

- **GitHub Environment**: A protected environment named `dev` is configured in repository settings with required reviewers. The apply job cannot start without approval.
- **Apply IAM Role**: A separate role with write permissions across all managed services (EC2/VPC, IAM, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, SNS, SSM). Its trust policy requires the OIDC `sub` claim to be `repo:{org}/{repo}:environment:dev` — a value that is only present when a job explicitly runs inside the protected environment.
- **`iam:PassRole` scoping**: The most sensitive IAM permission is double-restricted: it can only pass roles whose names match the project naming convention (`cloud-ops-lab-*`), and only to the EC2 service. It cannot be used to escalate privileges to any other AWS service.
- **`-auto-approve` is safe here**: The plan was reviewed during the PR. Manual approval was given through the GitHub Environment gate. The apply job uses `-auto-approve` because the human decision point is the approval step, not a Terraform prompt.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) configured with credentials that have broad permissions (only needed for the one-time bootstrap)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) >= 1.5
- A GitHub repository (this project or your fork)
- An AWS account — all resources are within Free Tier limits

### Step 1 — Bootstrap (run once)

The bootstrap uses **local** Terraform state and creates the shared infrastructure that all environments depend on: the S3 state bucket, the DynamoDB lock table, the GitHub OIDC provider, and the two CI/CD IAM roles.

```bash
cd bootstrap
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Fill in your values in terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Save the outputs — you will need the two role ARNs in the next step:

```bash
terraform output ci_role_arn
terraform output apply_role_arn
```

### Step 2 — Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `AWS_CI_ROLE_ARN` | Output of `terraform output ci_role_arn` |
| `AWS_APPLY_ROLE_ARN` | Output of `terraform output apply_role_arn` |

### Step 3 — Create the GitHub Environment

Go to your repository → **Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment**

- Name: `dev` (exact, lowercase — the workflow and IAM trust policy both match this string)
- Enable **Required reviewers** and add yourself
- Click **Save protection rules**

### Step 4 — Deploy via Pull Request

```bash
git checkout -b feature/initial-deploy
# Make any change to trigger the workflow
git add .
git commit -m "chore: trigger initial deploy"
git push -u origin feature/initial-deploy
```

Open a Pull Request targeting `main`. The plan workflow runs automatically and posts the full Terraform plan as a PR comment. Review it, then merge.

After merge, the apply workflow triggers. It pauses at the environment gate. Go to **Actions**, click the pending run, then **Review deployments → Approve and deploy**.

### Step 5 — Access the instance (no SSH required)

```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform output instance_id

aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>
```

### Step 6 — Run the automation scripts

From the CLI:

```bash
# Health check — collects metrics and writes a DynamoDB item
aws ssm send-command \
  --document-name "cloud-ops-lab-dev-health-check" \
  --targets "Key=instanceids,Values=<instance-id>"

# Log a custom event
aws ssm send-command \
  --document-name "cloud-ops-lab-dev-log-event" \
  --parameters '{"EventType":["deployment"],"Message":["Released v1.0"]}' \
  --targets "Key=instanceids,Values=<instance-id>"
```

View results: **AWS Console → DynamoDB → Tables → cloud-ops-lab-dev-ops-logs → Explore items**

### Tear down

```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"

# Remove bootstrap resources (optional)
cd ../../bootstrap
terraform destroy
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

**No SSH, no key pairs.**
SSM Session Manager provides interactive shell access over HTTPS. No inbound port is ever open. There is no private key to manage, rotate, or accidentally commit to Git.

**Remote state with locking.**
State lives in S3 with versioning enabled. DynamoDB provides atomic lock acquisition. If a `terraform apply` is interrupted, the lock prevents a second run from starting until the first lock is explicitly released or expires.

**Modular Terraform.**
Each module has exactly one responsibility. `environments/dev/main.tf` is a composition layer — it wires modules together with environment-specific values but contains no resource definitions itself. Adding a `prod` environment means writing a new composition with different inputs, reusing the same modules.

**`count` driven by a boolean, not a computed ARN.**
The ops-automation IAM policy is conditional. Using `count = var.dynamodb_table_arn != null ? 1 : 0` fails at plan time because the ARN is a computed value (only known after apply). Using `count = var.enable_ops_automation ? 1 : 0` works because a boolean input variable is always known at plan time.

**OIDC `sub` claim scoped to a GitHub Environment.**
The apply IAM role trust policy uses `StringEquals` (not `StringLike`) to match `repo:{org}/{repo}:environment:dev`. This value is only present in the OIDC token when the job explicitly declares `environment: dev` — which triggers the GitHub Environment protection rules. The two gates (approval + cryptographic OIDC condition) are independent and both must pass.

## AWS Free Tier Compatibility

| Resource | Free Tier limit | This project uses |
|---|---|---|
| EC2 | 750 hrs/month (t2.micro or t3.micro) | 1 instance |
| S3 | 5 GB storage, 20,000 GET requests | < 1 MB total |
| DynamoDB | 25 GB storage, 200M requests/month | 2 tables, minimal traffic |
| CloudWatch | 10 custom metrics, 5 GB log ingestion/month | 1 alarm, system logs |
| SSM | Free for Standard tier parameters and Run Command | Standard tier only |
| SNS | 1M publishes/month | 1 topic, alarm-triggered |

> **Note:** `t3.micro` is Free Tier eligible on accounts created after December 2024. If your account qualifies only for `t2.micro`, update `instance_type` in `environments/dev/dev.tfvars`.

## Troubleshooting

**`terraform init` fails — module does not exist**
All six module directories (`vpc`, `iam`, `ec2`, `cloudwatch`, `dynamodb`, `ssm`) must be present. If any are missing, the repository was cloned from an incomplete commit. Pull the latest commits from all branches.

**CloudWatch logs not appearing in the console**
Amazon Linux 2023 does not write to `/var/log/messages` without `rsyslog`. The `user_data` script installs it, but `user_data` only runs on first boot. If the instance already existed before this change, it must be replaced: `terraform taint module.ec2.aws_instance.ops` then `terraform apply`.

**SSM Run Command exits with code 127**
Exit code 127 means "executable not found". This is almost always caused by a Windows carriage return (`\r`) in the shebang line. Check the SSM document with `aws ssm get-document --name cloud-ops-lab-dev-health-check` and look for `\r` at the end of lines. The Terraform SSM module normalises line endings before creating the document — re-running `terraform apply` recreates the documents with corrected content.

**GitHub Actions: "Given variables file dev.tfvars does not exist"**
`environments/dev/dev.tfvars` must be committed to the repository. Run `git ls-files environments/dev/dev.tfvars` — if it returns nothing, the file is either missing or excluded by `.gitignore`. Verify `.gitignore` does not contain a broad `*.tfvars` rule; it should only list `terraform.tfvars` and `*.auto.tfvars`.

**Apply workflow OIDC authentication fails**
The apply IAM role trust policy uses `StringEquals` on the OIDC `sub` claim. The job must declare `environment: dev` (exact case, no spaces). Confirm the GitHub Environment is named `dev` in repository Settings and that `AWS_APPLY_ROLE_ARN` is set as a repository secret.
